%ComputeJointDistribution Computes the joint distribution defined by a set
% of given factors
%
%   Joint = ComputeJointDistribution(F) computes the joint distribution
%   defined by a set of given factors
%
%   Joint is a factor that encapsulates the joint distribution given by F
%   F is a vector of factors (struct array) containing the factors 
%     defining the distribution
%

function Joint = ComputeJointDistribution(F)

  % Check for empty factor list

      Joint = struct('var', [], 'card', [], 'val', []);
