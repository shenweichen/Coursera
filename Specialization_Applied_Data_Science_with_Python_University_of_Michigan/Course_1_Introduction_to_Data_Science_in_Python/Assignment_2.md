# Assignment 2 - Pandas Introduction
All questions are weighted the same in this assignment.
## Part 1
The following code loads the olympics dataset (olympics.csv), which was derrived from the Wikipedia entry on [All Time Olympic Games Medals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table), and does some basic data cleaning. 

The columns are organized as # of Summer games, Summer medals, # of Winter games, Winter medals, total # number of games, total # of medals. Use this dataset to answer the questions below.


```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('olympics.csv', index_col=0, skiprows=1)

for col in df.columns:
    if col[:2]=='01':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Gold'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='02':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Silver'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:2]=='03':
        df.rename(columns={col:'Bronze'+col[4:]}, inplace=True)
    if col[:1]=='№':
        df.rename(columns={col:'#'+col[1:]}, inplace=True)

names_ids = df.index.str.split('\s\(') # split the index by '('

df.index = names_ids.str[0] # the [0] element is the country name (new index) 
df['ID'] = names_ids.str[1].str[:3] # the [1] element is the abbreviation or ID (take first 3 characters from that)

df = df.drop('Totals')
df.head()
```

### Question 0 (Example)

What is the first country in df?

*This function should return a Series.*


```python
# You should write your whole answer within the function provided. The autograder will call
# this function and compare the return value against the correct solution value
def answer_zero():
    # This function returns the row for Afghanistan, which is a Series object. The assignment
    # question description will tell you the general format the autograder is expecting
    return df.iloc[0]

# You can examine what your function returns by calling it in the cell. If you have questions
# about the assignment formats, check out the discussion forums for any FAQs
answer_zero() 
```




    # Summer           13
    Gold                0
    Silver              0
    Bronze              2
    Total               2
    # Winter            0

    Total.1             0
    # Games            13
    Gold.2              0
    Silver.2            0
    Bronze.2            2
    Combined total      2
    ID                AFG
    Name: Afghanistan, dtype: object



### Question 1
Which country has won the most gold medals in summer games?

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_one():
    
    return df['Gold'].argmax()
answer_one()
```




    'United States'



### Question 2
Which country had the biggest difference between their summer and winter gold medal counts?

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_two():
    df['diff']=df['Gold']-df['Gold.1']
    
    return df['diff'].argmax()
answer_two()
```




    'United States'



### Question 3
Which country has the biggest difference between their summer gold medal counts and winter gold medal counts relative to their total gold medal count? 

$$\frac{Summer~Gold - Winter~Gold}{Total~Gold}$$

Only include countries that have won at least 1 gold in both summer and winter.

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_three():
    df3= df[(df['Gold']>0)&(df['Gold.1']>0)]
    return (df3['diff']/df3['Gold.2']).argmax()
answer_three()
```




    'Bulgaria'



### Question 4
Write a function to update the dataframe to include a new column called "Points" which is a weighted value where each gold medal counts for 3 points, silver medals for 2 points, and bronze mdeals for 1 point. The function should return only the column (a Series object) which you created.

*This function should return a Series named `Points` of length 146*


```python
def answer_four():
    df['Points'] = df['Gold.2']*3 + df['Silver.2']*2 + df['Bronze.2']*1

    return df['Points']
answer_four()
```

## Part 2
For the next set of questions, we will be using census data from the [United States Census Bureau](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/CO-EST2015-alldata.html). Counties are political and geographic subdivisions of states in the United States. This dataset contains population data for counties and states in the US from 2010 to 2015. [See this document](http://www.census.gov/popest/data/counties/totals/2015/files/CO-EST2015-alldata.pdf) for a description of the variable names.

The census dataset (census.csv) should be loaded as census_df. Answer questions using this as appropriate.

### Question 5
Which state has the most counties in it? (hint: consider the sumlevel key carefully! You'll need this for future questions too...)

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
census_df = pd.read_csv('census.csv')
census_df.head()
```

    'Texas'



### Question 6
Only looking at the three most populous counties for each state, what are the three most populous states (in order of highest population to lowest population)?

*This function should return a list of string values.*


```python
def answer_six():
    newdf = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50].copy()
    grouped = newdf.groupby('STNAME',as_index=False)

    ans.sort_values(by='CENSUS2010POP',inplace=True,ascending = False)
    return list(ans['STNAME'][0:3])
answer_six()
```




    ['California', 'Texas', 'Illinois']



### Question 7
Which county has had the largest change in population within the five year period (hint: population values are stored in columns POPESTIMATE2010 through POPESTIMATE2015, you need to consider all five columns)?

*This function should return a single string value.*


```python
def answer_seven():
    newdf = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50].copy()
    newdf['changes'] = newdf['POPESTIMATE2015'] - newdf['POPESTIMATE2010']
    return newdf['CTYNAME'][newdf['changes'].argmax()]

    'Harris County'



### Question 8
In this datafile, the United States is broken up into four regions using the "REGION" column. 

Create a query that finds the counties that belong to regions 1 or 2, whose name starts with 'Washington', and whose POPESTIMATE2015 was greater than their POPESTIMATE 2014.

*This function should return a 5x2 DataFrame with the columns = ['STNAME', 'CTYNAME'] and the same index ID as the census_df (sorted ascending by index).*


```python
def answer_eight():
    newdf = census_df[census_df['SUMLEV']==50].copy()
    newdf=newdf[((newdf['REGION']==1)|(newdf['REGION']==2))&(newdf['POPESTIMATE2015']>newdf['POPESTIMATE2014'])]
    newdf = pd.DataFrame(newdf[newdf['CTYNAME'].apply(lambda x: False if x.find('Washington')==-1 else True)],columns=['STNAME','CTYNAME'])
    return newdf
answer_eight()
```
